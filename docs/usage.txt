1. collect all mbox files your archive is comprised of into one
directory.

2. decide upon a base directory where all the unpacked attachments (as
well as serialized state--for details see phases.txt) should be
stored; if you don't care, no problem, some directory under /tmp will
be choosen. ml2json will create a symlink at ~/.ml2json-tmp which
points to that generated directory, so that subsequent runs of ml2json
will find it again and can omit part of the work that was already
done. If you want to keep the generated attachments, specify the
--attachment-basedir option.

3. it's possible to customize what fields are output in the JSON by
using a config file; see example_config.pl and ./mk2json --help.

4. run './mk2json sourcedir targetfile', perhaps with the additional
options of your choice.

5. optionally, to clean up the generated temporary / attachments
files, run ml2json with the --cleanup option; if you gave the
--attachment-basedir option before, it has to be given again,
otherwise ml2json will just look at ~/.ml2json-tmp (or do nothing if
not present).
