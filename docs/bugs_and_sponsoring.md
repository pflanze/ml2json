This is the list of known bugs, as well as requested or suggested new
features.

I'm looking for sponsors for the project. The items that are prepared
for sponsoring come with a cost range and details about what is going
to be done, sometimes with choosable options. Sponsoring an item will
make me implement it quickly. Each item that is sponsored, gets the
sponsor's name and/or link in the commit message, as well as an entry
on a future sponsors page if desired. Please [contact
me](http://christianjaeger.ch/contact.html) if interested (payment
through PayPal, I'll also look into Stripe).
