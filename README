ml2json - convert mail archives to JSON streams

This project aims to provide for a safe, complete, and cleanly
written/configurable way to convert mail archives (like mailing lists)
to a simplified, but still correct, structured output in the form of
JSON (could be changed to other formats).

Care has been taken to allow it to work on huge archives (although
such tests are to be done), and to index the whole archive so as to
clean up in-reply-to headers and provide for forward references
("replies").

This work was initially developed for ABA-NET/Architexturez Imprints.
