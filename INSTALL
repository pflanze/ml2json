For convenience, the (required parts of my) ftemplate and perllib
libraries have been merged into this repository for now (in the
future, I will properly package those libraries as separate CPAN
modules and then just ask to install from there or from their own
Github repositories).

The other non-standard dependencies can be installed on a
Debian-derived Linux system using:

 apt-get install libmime-tools-perl libmail-box-perl libemail-date-perl libhtml-tree-perl

Or install MIME::Tools, Mail::Box, HTML::Tree and Email::Date from CPAN.
