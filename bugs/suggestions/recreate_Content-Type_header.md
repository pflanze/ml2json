Some pseudo mbox files (probably meant to be read by humans, not by
computers) as generated by some archival software strip the
content-type header of the original mail even though they still have
MIME entities in the text.

Try to detect MIME contents in the body and restore the content-type
header. (Solve the "email does not have a content-type header" warning
cases.)
