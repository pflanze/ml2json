Possible future work:

Give a way to make IMG src values reference the right image attachment

Look at 'references' headers (more precise than threading according to
subject in the case where in-reply-to can not be found).

A better way to handle dates in mbox separators (--max-date-deviation
option): only use those after a confirmation pass that suggests that
they are usefully tied to the arrival date of the mails.

Look at dates in 'Received' headers, too? But how to decide which ones
are trustworthy?

Worrying a bit about people having "sun style" mbox files, which the
current mbox parser will not handle well (see docs/mbox.txt). Offer to
use one of the other mbox parsers by way of a config option, or
improve lib/Chj/Ml2json/Mbox.pm? The author has never seen one of
those, would need your support to test for the latter.
